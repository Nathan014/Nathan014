I’m a Backend & AI Engineer focused on building scalable automation, intelligent systems, and high-performance backend services using Python, FastAPI, and Django. I specialize in async architectures, REST APIs, cloud deployment, and browser automation with Playwright.

I combine backend engineering with applied AI to accelerate development and deliver reliable, real-world automation. I’ve strengthened my data and ML skills through hands-on projects and Kaggle challenges.

I’m driven by building systems that eliminate manual effort, improve efficiency at scale, and push the boundaries of what automation and AI can achieve.
